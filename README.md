Data and R script:

Store all files in the same folder and set the working directory in the R script accordingly. The script works, but it's not very pretty and it becomes computationally quite expensive once it gets to the part that deals with LNRE modeling. R 64-bit is strongly recommended and 16GB Ram memory (i.e. if you don't want to do too much cleaning-up in between the steps).

I'm sure there are several ways to make the script run more efficiently. I'm happy for any comments or improvements.
